## Work habits of young people
Younger generations view the office as a place to not only work with their teams, but also to get their individual work done. Young workers more likely to rank “focus on my work” higher than other generations as top reasons for going into the office.
![Alt text](image-9.png)
Two out of three workers would prefer to work from a desk when they’re in the office. Again, we see unique generational differences. Almost half of the Boomer respondents prefer primarily working at the office at a desk not shared by others compared to just 25% of Boomers who prefer primarily working remotely but reserving a desk when they come into the office. Younger generations prefer having flexibility to work remotely over assigned desks at the office. About 70% of Gen Z, Millennials, and Gen X respondents prefer primarily working remotely — but when they come into the office, they prefer either at a reserved desk or an on-demand work setting in common areas. About 30% prefer working in the office at a desk not shared with others.
![Alt text](image-10.png)
Data from the newly released 1997 National Health Interview Survey show that 4 in 10 U.S. adults say that they NEVER engage in any exercises, sports, or physically active hobbies in their leisure time. Estimates of sedentary behavior shown here are based on responses to a series of questions asking how often and how long respondents engaged in leisure physical activities for at least 20 minutes that caused sweating or changes in their heart rate or breathing. Sedentary behavior has been identified as a risk factor for a variety of chronic health conditions, including coronary heart disease, hypertension, colon cancer, and diabetes mellitus.
![Alt text](image-11.png)
About 40% of U.S. adults were sedentary in 1997, engaging in no leisure time physical activities of any kind. Women (43.2%) were somewhat more likely than men (36.5%) to be sedentary, a finding that held in every age group.
![Alt text](image-12.png)
Adults who met the sedentary time threshold were more likely to meet the physical activity recommendation than those who did not. Similarly, adults who met all three sedentary thresholds were more likely to also meet the physical activity recommendation compared with those who did not.

### 2.SVM Algorithm
SVM, which stands for Support Vector Machine, is a machine learning algorithm widely used in pattern recognition, image analysis, text classification, and other fields.
The main idea of SVM is to find a hyperplane that can separate different categories of data points into different sides as much as possible. In other words, SVM is a classification algorithm.
SVM is a type of learning model that separates instances of two classes of objects. The main idea of SVM is to use a separating hyperplane to maximize the distance between the two classes. The hyperplane is defined by a set of support vectors that are closest to the plane. SVM is effective even if the training set is not linearly separable.
SVM has two main types: linear SVM and kernel SVM. Linear SVM uses a linear kernel function to calculate the distance between instances, while kernel SVM uses a non-linear kernel function to calculate the distance. 
Example: Design of Human Sitting Posture Detection System Based on SVM Algorithm
In order to monitor siting posture in time and improve the health status, this paper designs a siting posture detection system by using computer vision metho. Through sampling the existing siting image data set, the image features are obtained by using OpenCV to detect skin color, The image features are classified and labeled to generate data set files. The algorithm of siting position detection in this paper combines SVM and OpenCV cascade detector to realize the function of rea-time siting posture display and voice reminder, which can effectively detect the bad siting posture, and has certain application value.

### 3. FSR Pressure Sensor
FSR pressure sensor is a type of pressure sensor that utilizes Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) technology. FSR sensors are typically used for measuring pressure or force applied to a specific surface, and they are commonly used in applications such as electronic skins for monitoring human activities or robotics.
FSR sensors consist of a thin, flexible material that is sandwiched between two electrodes. When pressure is applied to the sensor, it changes its resistance value, which can be measured and converted into a readable output signal. The output signal can then be used to determine the amount of pressure applied to the sensor.
Example: Design of Sitting Position Detection System Based on FSR Pressure Sensor
The paper designs a test system for student sitting safety state monitoring. Through the FSR pressure sensor, the pressure signal generated by the bending of the student's collar and spine is collected, and the STM32 single-chip microcomputer is used for effective detection and processing. Finally, the sensor data completed by external treatment is wirelessly sent to the PC, which realizes the collection and real-time display of sensor pressure data in different sitting safety states. The test results show that the designed system can obviously judge the characteristics of poor sitting posture, and can remotely monitor the student's sitting posture.
